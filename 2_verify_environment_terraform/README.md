1. Create a directory e.g. /home/ec2-user/prashant and change the directory to prashant.
2. Clone the GIT repository aws-infrastructure-capstone-project using the command:
   git clone git@github.com:prashant-aggarwal/aws-infrastructure-capstone-project.git
3. Change the working directory to 2_verify_environment_terraform using the command:
   cd aws-infrastructure-capstone-project/2_verify_environment_terraform/
4. Run the following commands in the given sequence for creation of a virtual machine in the region "us-east-2":
	terraform fmt .
	terraform init
	terraform plan
	terraform apply-auto-approve

	Sample output:
	aws_instance.vm: Creating...
	aws_instance.vm: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
	aws_instance.vm: Creation complete after 12s [id=i-0c1a6c74f4ae72b1a]

	Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

	Outputs:

	public_ip_address = "3.15.34.139"
6. Verify that the EC2 with the instance id generated by terraform is available in EC2 Console.
7. Terminate the EC2 instance using the command: terraform destroy -auto-approve. Sample output:
	Changes to Outputs:
	  - public_ip_address = "3.15.34.139" -> null
	aws_instance.vm: Destroying... [id=i-0c1a6c74f4ae72b1a]
	aws_instance.vm: Still destroying... [id=i-0c1a6c74f4ae72b1a, 10s elapsed]
